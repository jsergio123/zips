Version 1.0.6jb (jasonbuechler's update)
- Adult Swim site update required regex adjustment
- fixed: json response moved some elements around
- disabled get-metadata by default to very lazily avoid bug: metahandler.py, line 422, in _get_tvdb_meta -- ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: ''
